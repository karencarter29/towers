# towers

Implementation of the Towers of Hanoi game.

Three rods are given, on one of which eight rings are strung, and the rings differ in size and lie smaller on the larger.
The task is to move a pyramid of eight rings in the least number of moves to another rod.
Only one ring can be carried at a time, and you cannot put a larger ring on a smaller one.
The program should provide the ability to change disks, control the correctness of moves and count the execution time.
